a knowledgegraph and qa system base on chinese medical data!
how to use:
firstly,sign up a neo4j account and use the folder name "data" to load the data in knoeledgegraph
this may take a long time up to three hours cause the medical data is too large
and then, cd backend (you probably need to pip install the requirement),and python app.py
then you'll come to a qa-system.
